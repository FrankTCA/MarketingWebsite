# Marketing Website

Writing this for a school project.

Written in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) using the [Ananke](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke) theme.

In the class project, we wanted to optimize a website for marketing purposes. We choose to use [Deja Brew](https://www.deja-brewsouthie.com/), a local business (check them out they're really good if you're in the Boston area).

I am publishing the site, probably not permanantly to [joe.infotoast.org](https://joe.infotoast.org).

The images are mostly copyrighted by Deja Brew, but I know they don't mind me using them, and it meets Fair Use qualifications due to being for educational purposes, but do be cautious if using this project for other code.
